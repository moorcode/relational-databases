# Relationsal Databases

## Boilerplate

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

This course runs in a virtual Linux machine using Gitpod. Alternatively, download Microsoft VS Code. I will be using my local environment to run VS Code with a bash terminal.

1. __The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.__ Do that in VS Code the short way by pressing `ctrl+shift+\`\` , or the long way by clicking the _hamburger_ menu at the top left of the screen, going to the _terminal_ section, and clicking _new terminal_. Or, start a terminal locally. Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

	```
	moorcode MINGW644 /c/Users/moorcode/relational-databases/boilerplate (main)
	$ echo hello terminal
	hello terminal
	```

2. What you see in the terminal is a __folder (or directory)__ on your machine. Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter to see the __path__ of the folder. `pwd` stands for __print working directory__.

	```
	moorcode MINGW644 /c/Users/moorcode/relational-databases/boilerplate (main)
	$ pwd
	/c/Users/moorcode/relational-databases/boilerplate
	```

3. The output tells you where the folder you are in is located. In Gitpod, you are in the project folder, which is in the workspace folder. Type `ls` into the terminal to see what's in this folder. `ls` stands for __list__. I am in my boilerplate folder, which is in the relational-database folder, which is in the moorcode folder, which is in the Users folder, which is in the C drive.

	```
	moorcode MINGW644 /c/Users/moorcode/relational-databases/boilerplate (main)
	$ ls
	README.md
	```

4. In Gitpod, the output is showing everything in this folder. There's one folder in there. You can use `cd <folder_name>` to go into a folder. `cd` stands for __change directory__. In Gitpod, change to the `freeCodeCamp` directory. I'll stay wher I am since I only have a README file.
> [!TIP]
> `Tab`will complete the folder name.


5. You are in the freecodecamp folder now. You may have noticed that the prompt changed to include it. Print the working directory of the freeCodeCamp folder to see the full path of where you are.
