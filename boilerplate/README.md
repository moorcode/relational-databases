## Boilerplate

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

This course runs in a virtual Linux machine using Gitpod. Alternatively, download Microsoft VS Code.

1. __The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.__ Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Or, start a terminal locally. Once you open a new one, type echo hello terminal into the terminal and press enter.

```
hello terminal
```

2. What you see in the terminal below is a folder (or directory) on this machine. Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter to see the path of the folder. `pwd` stands for "print working directory".

```
Path
----
C:\Users\moorcode
```
