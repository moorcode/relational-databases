## Boilerplate

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

This course runs in a virtual Linux machine using Gitpod. Alternatively, download Microsoft VS Code.

1. __The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.__ Do that in VS Code the short way by pressing `ctrl+shift+\`\` , or the long way by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Or, start a terminal locally. Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

```
hello terminal
```

2. What you see in the terminal below is a folder (or directory) on this machine. Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter to see the path of the folder. `pwd` stands for "print working directory".

```
/c/Users/moorcode/relational-databases/boilerplate
```

3. The output tells you where the folder you are in is located. You are in the project folder, which is in the workspace folder. Type ls into the terminal to see what's in this folder. ls stands for "list".
