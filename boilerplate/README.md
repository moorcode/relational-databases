## Boilerplate

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

This course runs in a virtual Linux machine using Gitpod. Alternatively, download Microsoft VS Code.

1. __The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.__ Do that in VS Code the short way by pressing `ctrl+shift+\`\` , or the long way by clicking the _hamburger_ menu at the top left of the screen, going to the _terminal_ section, and clicking _new terminal_. Or, start a terminal locally. Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

```
$ echo hello terminal
hello terminal
```

2. What you see in the terminal is a __folder (or directory)__ on your machine. Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter to see the __path__ of the folder. `pwd` stands for __print working directory__.

```
$ pwd
/c/Users/moorcode/relational-databases/boilerplate
```

3. The output tells you where the folder you are in is located. You are in the project folder, which is in the workspace folder. Type `ls` into the terminal to see what's in this folder. `ls` stands for __list__.

```
$ ls
README.md
```
